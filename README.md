# mac-setup

I own two Macs. I do clean installs fairly often. This is here to take away some of the pain, not only to automate some parts of the process, but also to remind me what needs doing to get the machine back to how I like it.

Run the scripts in the following order:

* `os-x.sh`
* `install-deps-1.sh`
* `install-deps-2.sh`

This must be done manually because it is required that you restart the terminal in the middle of the process.

If you have tips for how I can automate anything that I am not already, let me know. In particular I would love to know more commands for setting system preferences, some of which I currently have to do as manual steps.
